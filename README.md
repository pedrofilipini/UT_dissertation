These folders contain the code used in each Chapter of my dissertation presented to the University of Texas at Austin.

Disclaimer: the documentation for each model is minimal. This version is functional but not intended for general use by most practitioners in its present form. A polished release with full documentation, clean code, and without placeholder elements in the code will be available in the future.
